### Project Description
SlangSwap – A fun web app that translates slang words from one Kerala district into the slang of all other districts, complete with pronunciation and examples.
Currently, the database contains only a small set of slang words for demo purposes — but it can be expanded in the future to include hundreds more.
You can check these database entries for testing and verification during development.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Keralites love their slang, but sometimes slang from one district sounds like alien language to another district.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A slang translator that instantly converts your local slang into equivalent slang from  other Kerala district — because why not? 😄
